An app that uses a has_many :through association as an exercise in using a join model. A personal exercise in using Bootstrap. 

In my example, there exists a galaxy of space cats. A space cat has many adventures through contracts. Differenet adventures may have different locations. Contracts keep track of the individual cat name (not ID!) and location! Soon, there will be payment option added in the contracts. 

Rails 4.0.2
Ruby 2.1.0
